> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, C++ course, episode 16 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V7a1Gwuj5k) )

## General info
Learning what is a binary tree. A simple program with a main menu allows to choose useful functions demonstrating what a binary tree is, how it works and how to interact with it:
* `wyswietl_drzewo()` - displays the whole binary tree graphically
* `add()` - adds an element to the binary tree
* `find()` - searches for an element in the binary tree

## Technologies
* C++
* CodeBlocks (IDE)
* GNU GCC Compiler (minGW)
